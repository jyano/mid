Children of containers have their transform and alpha properties concatenated with their parent Container.

For example, a Shape with x=100 and alpha=0.5, placed in a Container with x=50 and alpha=0.7 will be rendered to the canvas at x=150 and alpha=0.35. Containers have some overhead, so you generally shouldn't create a Container to hold a single child.

Example

 var container = new createjs.Container();
 container.addChild(bitmapInstance, shapeInstance);
 container.x = 100;
