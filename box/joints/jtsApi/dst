w.dJ

// location pams are optional, and   default to their center ponts
// note: if you passe them in, pass them as local   coords

// BOX2D requires them as WORLD points - for some reason.. (but i think my way has more use cases)

//use g.p  for 'collideConnected=true' joints

// ok, so the 'points' are relative to the WORLD
// here there are no default lengths, they are set to actual distance apart at time of joint creation!!!
//  previously:  j0 =  w.J(   b2d.dJ().init(b,r)   )
// i want to be able to specify how much to offset the anchor point, relative from its own center!!!!
