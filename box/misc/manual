  
Box2D defines various types such as float32, int8, etc. to make it easy to determine the size of structures.

 
Box2D defines several constants. These are all documented in b2Settings.h. Normally you do not need to adjust these constants.

Box2D uses floating point math for collision and simulation. Due to round-off error some numerical tolerances are defined.
 Some tolerances are absolute and some are relative.  Absolute tolerances use MKS units.

Allocation wrappers
The settings file defines b2Alloc and b2Free for large allocations.
 You may forward these calls to your own memory management system.

Version
The b2Version structure holds the current version so you can query this at run-time.
