 //Backbone.history
 //
 //History serves as a global router (per frame)
 // to handle hashchange events or pushState,
 // match the appropriate route, 
 // and trigger callbacks.
 // You shouldn't ever have to create one of these yourself since Backbone.history already contains one.
 //
 //pushState support exists on a purely opt-in basis in Backbone.
 // Older browsers that don't support pushState will continue to use hash-based URL fragments,
 // and if a hash URL is visited by a pushState-capable browser, 
 // it will be transparently upgraded to the true URL.
 // Note that using real URLs requires your web server 
 // to be able to correctly render those pages, 
 // so back-end changes are required as well.
 // For example, if you have a route of /documents/100,
 // your web server must be able to serve that page,
 // if the browser visits that URL directly.
 // 
 // For full search-engine crawlability,
 // it's best to have the server generate the complete HTML for the page
 // ... but if it's a web application, 
 // just rendering the same content you would have for the root URL,
 // and filling in the rest with Backbone Views and JavaScript works fine.
 
 //startBackbone.history.start([options]) 
 //When all of your Routers have been created, and all of the routes are set up properly,
 // call Backbone.history.start() to begin monitoring hashchange events, and dispatching routes.
 // Subsequent calls to Backbone.history.start() will throw an error,
 // and Backbone.History.started is a boolean value indicating whether it has already been called.
 
 //To indicate that you'd like to use HTML5 pushState support in your application,
 // use Backbone.history.start({pushState: true}). If you'd like to use pushState,
 // but have browsers that don't support it natively use full page refreshes instead,
 // you can add {hashChange: false} to the options.
 
 //If your application is not being served from the root url / of your domain,
 // be sure to tell History where the root really is, as an option: 
 // Backbone.history.start({pushState: true, root: "/public/search/"})
 
 //When called, if a route succeeds with a match for the current URL,
 // Backbone.history.start() returns true. If no defined route matches the current URL, it returns false.
 
 //If the server has already rendered the entire page,
 // and you don't want the initial route to trigger when starting History, pass silent: true.
 
 //Because hash-based history in Internet Explorer relies on an <iframe>, 
 // be sure to call start() only after the DOM is ready.

  //For example, a route of "search/:query/p:page"

  //
  //A route of "docs/:section(/:subsection)"

  // passing "faq" to the action in the first case, 
  // and passing "faq" and "installing" to the action in the second.
