dirtpage
========

DirtPage is a PHP and JavaScript-based platform for text and image collaboration.

DirtPage was conceived by Jason Yanofski and Christopher Morgan over several months and often heated phone conversations about database normalization.

Chris was right, by the way.

The concept of DirtPage was to allow users to add content in the form of comments (with some image capability).  Users could then comment on each comment and vote them up or down.
Built into each comment was the concept of linking to other content automatically and dynamically, meaning any word in a comment could become a keyword linked to the same keyword in other comments.
