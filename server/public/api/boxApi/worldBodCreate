// ok lets start here, we create a body with just a bodyDef
// so just what is this b.f?  its how a body creates a fixture
// obviously..
//but it would be nicer if we could also pass in
//one (or more (as an array)) of fixtures right away
//if we only have one fixture (simple body), then
//it is especially helpful timesaver over the long run
//(turn two steps to one!)
//if u want just a ball body with one ball fixture..
// we are going to assume u want it centered
//if not, dont use this.. this is for simple uses cases..
//w.ball is easy.. pass it x, y, and r
