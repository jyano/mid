// You may want a rigid body, such as a character, to have a fixed rotation.
// Such a body should not rotate, even under load.
 // You can use the fixed rotation setting to achieve this: bodyDef.fixedRotation = true;
 // The fixed rotation flag causes the rotational inertia 
  and its inverse to be set to zero.
