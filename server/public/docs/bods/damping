// Damping is used to reduce the world velocity of bodies. 
// Damping is different than friction because friction only occurs with contact. 
// Damping is not a replacement for friction and the two effects should be used together.
 
// Damping parameters should be between 0 and infinity, 
// with 0 meaning no damping, and infinity meaning full damping.
// Normally you will use a damping value between 0 and 0.1.
// I generally do not use linear damping because it makes bodies look floaty.
// bodyDef.linearDamping = 0.0f; bodyDef.angularDamping = 0.01f;
// Damping is approximated for stability and performance.
// At small damping values the damping effect is mostly independent of the time step. 
// At larger damping values, the damping effect will vary with the time step. 
// This is not an issue if you use a fixed time step (recommended).
// After creating a body, there are many operations you can perform on the body.
// These include setting mass properties, accessing position and velocity,
// applying forces, and transforming points and vectors.
