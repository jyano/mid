**bodyDef:
 You should establish the body type at creation
 because changing the body type later is expensive.

 bodyDef.type = b2_dynamicBody;
 
 Setting the body type is mandatory.

***  b2_staticBody does not move under simulation and behaves as if it has infinite mass.
// Internally, Box2D stores zero for the mass and the inverse mass. 
-can be moved manually by the user. 
-has zero velocity.
-do not collide with other static or kinematic bodies.
 
 
**  b2_kinematicBody moves under simulation according to its velocity.
// Kinematic bodies do not respond to forces.
// They can be moved manually by the user, but normally a kinematic body is moved by setting its velocity.
// A kinematic body behaves as if it has infinite mass, however,
// Box2D stores zero for the mass and the inverse mass.
// Kinematic bodies do not collide with other static or kinematic bodies.
 
*  b2_dynamicBody  fully simulated. They can be moved manually by the user,
// but normally  move according to forces. A dynamic body can collide with all body types. 
// A dynamic body always has finite, non-zero mass.
// If you try to set the mass of a dynamic body to zero, 
// it will automatically acquire a mass of one kilogram.
