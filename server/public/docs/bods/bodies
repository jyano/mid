Bodies have position, velocity -can apply:impulses, forces,  torques -can be: static, kinematic, dynamic 

   
 
// Joints may be connected to inactive bodies. These joints will not be simulated. 
// *be careful when you activate a body that its joints are not distorted.
//

// User Data is a void pointer. This gives you a hook to link your application objects to bodies. // You should be consistent to use the same object type for all body user data.// bodyDef= b2BodyDef(); bodyDef.userData = &myActor;

 
 

 
  
// You can access the linear and angular velocity. 
// The linear velocity is for the center of mass. 
// Therefore, the linear velocity may change if the mass properties change.
