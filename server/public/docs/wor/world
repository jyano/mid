 b2World class contains the bodies and joints. 
 It manages all aspects of the simulation and allows for asynchronous queries (like AABB queries and ray-casts). 
 
  
// Creating and Destroying a World
// Creating a world is fairly simple. 
You just need to provide a gravity vector and a Boolean indicating if bodies can sleep. 
Usually you will create and destroy a world using new and delete.
// b2World* myWorld = new b2World(gravity, doSleep);
//
// ... do stuff ...
//
// delete myWorld;
