 Warm starting is a general notion that you can use information generated in the previous simulation timestep 
	to help you come up with more accurate results, faster, in the current timestep.
		 
	  But in Box2D it's mostly used to refer to velocity and position correction, 
	  			which are determined using an iterative solver which isn't perfect but comes closer to perfect every time you run it, 
	  					and even closer if you start it off with a number that is close to the desired result. 

Continuous physics is a feature such that, while the physics may be simulated with a finite number of discrete timesteps per second,
		 Box2D can make sure that solid objects will not pass through other solid objects, 
		 	even if they are moving so fast that the two objects are 
		 		not actually touching each other after any of the completed timesteps. 

Nevertheless,
	 in some situations objects may end up overlapping each other, 
	 			either because they started that way or because continuous physics was disabled between those two objects. 
	 			
	 		Position correction is an iterative process that separates overlapping objects. 

ContactListener.Result 
		is mostly used to get the magnitude of the impulse (aka force, sort of) between the two touching objects.

 
 box2d's CCD stops objects moving completely through each other,
  but it doesn't eliminate small overlaps, 
  so position correction is always necessary.


   perhaps warm starting should be used pretty much all the time, 
   and continuous physics and position correction is only necessary if you have problems with fast-moving objects. 
   I expect that warm starting is actually a performance improvement (or doesn't make any different),
    and the other two are performance hits.
 
 
As I said, you really need position correction all the time. 
I don't think there's even an option to turn it off.
 I'd leave CCD on if I were you too, it's not a bottleneck in most circumstances, 
 so why worry.
