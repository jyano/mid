 A joint edge:
 -connects bodies and joints together in a joint graph
 (each body is a node and each joint is an edge)
 -belongs to a doubly linked list maintained in each attached body
 (Each joint has two joint nodes, one for each attached body)
 //these are all obj refs, not functions

 .joint
 .other(other body)
 .prev(b2JointEdge):the previous joint edge in the body's joint list
 .next(b2JointEdge):the next joint edge in the body's joint list
