shape types: poly(p), circle(c), array(a)
box2d provides bH.GetType (GT) but this provides a number
i can also use contstructor to get the real shape name
	use b2d.isShape (iH) to get a letter representing the shape.. or false if it is not a shape at all..
or use bH.ty to get the letter type from a known shape
there are also checkers for for the specific shape types

use bH.rad to get/set radius
