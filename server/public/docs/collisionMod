 // The Collision module contains bilateral functions that take a pair of shapes and compute some results. These include:

 // 路         Overlap
 // 路         Contact manifolds
 // 路         Distance
 // 路         Time of impact

 // The b2Distance function can be used to compute the distance between two shapes.  The distance function needs both shapes to be converted into a b2DistanceProxy. There is also some caching used to warm start the distance function for repeated calls. You can see the details in b2Distance.h.
