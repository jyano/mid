bD.XY is the key function of body def prototype
//basically, it allows you to set the position of the bodydef,
//and hence, the body
 
 
/// ook we doin this shiiite with $bD..
// make just a basic bodyDef with default type (STATIC=0)
// dont matter.. cause we never gonna use that..
// instead be more explicit and create bodes 
// of the specific type u want:
// this is also a fine time to pass in x and y

//
//b.f is insteresting
// if you pass it it an array..
// it maps that through fxPar
// that's how we can pass arrays of numbers that 
// represent circle and rect fixts
//without having to instantiate them all the way ourselves!
