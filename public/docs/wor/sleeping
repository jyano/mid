// What does sleep mean? 
// Well it is expensive to simulate bodies,
// so the less we have to simulate the better. 
// When a body comes to rest we would like to stop simulating it.
// When Box2D determines that a body (or group of bodies) 
// has come to rest, the body enters a sleep state which 
// has very little CPU overhead.
// If a body is awake and collides with a sleeping body,
// then the sleeping body wakes up. 
// Bodies will also wake up if a joint or contact attached to them is destroyed.
// You can also wake a body manually.
// The body definition lets you specify whether a body can sleep
// and whether a body is created sleeping.
