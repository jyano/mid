// You can iterate over a body's fixtures. This is mainly useful if you need to access the fixture's user data.
//
// for (b2Fixture* f = body->GetFixtureList(); f; f = f->GetNext())  { 
		MyFixtureData* data = (MyFixtureData*) f.GetUserData(); ... do something with data ...  }

// You can similarly iterate over the body's joint list.
// The body also provides a list of associated contacts. 
You can use this to get information about the current contacts. 
Be careful, because the contact list may not contain all the contacts that existed during the previous time step.
