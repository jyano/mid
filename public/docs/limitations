Box2D uses several approximations to simulate rigid body physics efficiently. This brings some limitations.

Here are the current limitations:

1.       Stacking heavy bodies on top of much lighter bodies is not stable. Stability degrades as the mass ratio passes 10:1.
2.       Chains of bodies connected by joints may stretch if a lighter body is supporting a heavier body. 
For example, a wrecking ball connect to a chain of light weight bodies may not be stable. Stability degrades as the mass ratio passes 10:1.
3.       There is typically around 0.5cm of slop in shape versus shape collision.
4.       Continuous collision does not handle joints. So you may see joint stretching on fast moving objects.
