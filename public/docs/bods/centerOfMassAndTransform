// The center of mass is determined from mass distribution of the attached shapes 
// or is explicitly set with b2MassData. Much of Box2D's internal computations 
// use the center of mass position. 
For example b2Body stores the linear velocity for the center of mass.
//
// When you are building the body definition, you may not know where the center of mass is located.
// Therefore you specify the position of the body's origin. 
You may also specify the body's angle in radians, 
// which is not affected by the position of the center of mass. 
If you later change the mass properties of the body, 
// then the center of mass may move on the body, but the origin position 
// does not change and the attached shapes and joints do not move.
//
 -can access  center of mass position in local and world coordinates. 
// Much of the internal simulation in Box2D uses the center of mass. 
// However, you should normally not need to access it.
 
 
// Instead you will usually work with the body transform. 
// For example, you may have a body that is square.
// The body origin might be a corner of the square, 
// while the center of mass is located at the center of the square.
