// You usually keep pointers to all the bodies you create.
// This way you can query the body positions to update the positions of your graphical entities. 
// You should also keep body pointers so you can destroy them when you are done with them.
 
// Before a body is created you must create a body definition (b2BodyDef). 
// The body definition holds the data needed to create and initialize a body.
 
// Box2D copies the data out of the body definition; it does not keep a pointer to the body definition.
// This means you can recycle a body definition to create multiple bodies.
