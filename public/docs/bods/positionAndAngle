// This has far
 better performance than creating the body at the world origin and then moving the body.
//
// Caution
//
// Do not create a body at the origin and then move it. If you create several bodies at the origin,
// then performance will suffer.
 
 // Fixtures and joints are attached relative to the body's origin.
 
 
// bodyDef.position.Set(0.0f, 2.0f);   // the body's origin position.
// bodyDef.angle = 0.25f * b2_pi;      // the body's angle in radians.
 
 // You can access the position and rotation of a body.
 // This is common when rendering your associated game actor. 
 // You can also set the position,
 // although this is less common since you will normally use Box2D to simulate movement.
